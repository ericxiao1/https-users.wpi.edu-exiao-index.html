          <h1>Violin</h1>
          <p> Violin is an instrument I have played since I was about 8 years
            old. Before I started playing the violin, I played the piano.
            However, the piano wasn’t an option for an instrument in my middle
            school (Sherwood), so my parents wanted me to start playing a new
            instrument, so I could get a head-start. My mom recommended me to
            choose the violin, and she told me that it was the hardest
            instrument to play, so I decided to take on a hard challenge. </p>
          <p> In 2018, I started taking lessons from a violin teacher who used
            to teach one of my parents friends son. I learned how to play the
            instrument quickly, and I was able to playing simple pieces and was
            able to play in tune. However, bowing properly and holding the bow
            correctly were both challenges for me. Even though I was able to
            play all the notes correctly, and in tune, the sound quality would
            always ruin my performances. My teacher told me that it didn’t
            matter if I played all the notes correctly if my tone sounded
            squeaky. </p>
          <p> Knowing that I would need to improve my tone quality, I tried some
            ways to fix it. I would sometimes try to play from memory, and would
            focus on if I was bowing straight or play in a mirror. Eventually, I
            was able to fix most of my bad habits with bowing. My teacher
            recommended me to try out for the district auditions. She told me
            that I would have a good chance of making the cut, and that it would
            be beneficial for me in the future if I did. </p>
          <p> The song for the audition was a simple song, and a song I had
            played before. Just like my teacher predicted, I did make the cut,
            so I would have to commit two online orchestra concerts. I felt very
            achieved making it in the Junior Districts but I knew there was
            still some skills to work on. </p>
          <p> In conclusion, the violin has been a main hobby for me, and
            definitely a challenging instrument to play. </p>
